//This follows the same overall structure as the California example, with Washington-specific CDL requirements, fees, locations, and regulations. The data types and property names are consistent.  The DMV locations use realistic coordinates for Washington cities. The endorsement types and class types maintain the same format but contain Washington-specific details. The module exports an object with the same shape but all the details have been customized for the state of Washington.
